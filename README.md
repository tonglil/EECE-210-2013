===============

This is a WIP.

This was my attempt to make a parser using JavaScript in a modular way.  
Still many things can be improved (data constructor, graphing, executing script while in different directory).

There is a 'linearly' executed way of parsing the files, but the full-featured copy is the modular copy.

## Go!

* `cd` the `modular` directory
* `node script.js`

## Todo

* Add percentile finder
* Attach names to student IDs
